                <p>
                    Mangeshkar was born on 28 September 1929[18]: 67 in Indore (in the present-day Indore district of Madhya Pradesh), then the capital of the princely state of Indore which was part of the Central India Agency in British India.

                    Her father, Deenanath Mangeshkar was a Marathi and Konkani classical singer and theatre actor. Deenanath's father was Ganesh Bhatt Navathe Hardikar (Abhisheki), a Karhade Brahmin[19] who served as a priest at the famous Mangeshi Temple in Goa.[18] Deenanath's mother Yesubai Rane was his father's mistress[20] belonging to the Devadasi community of Goa,[21][19][22] a matrilineal community of temple artists now known as Gomantak Maratha Samaj.[23] As a Devadasi, Yesubai was a reputed musician. Deenanath's father's surname was Hardikar.[19]: 47–48  Deenanath had taken the surname Mangeshkar, based on the name of his ancestral village, Mangeshi in Goa.[23][21]
                    
                    Her mother, Shevanti (later renamed Shudhamati), was a Gujarati woman[24] from Thalner, Bombay Presidency (now in northwest Maharashtra). Shevanti was Deenanath's second wife; his first wife Narmada, who had died before his marriage to Shevanti, was Shevanti's older sister.[25] Her maternal grandfather, Seth Haridas Ramdas Lad, was from Gujarat, a prosperous businessman and landlord of Thalner. She learned Gujarati folk songs such as garbas of Pavagadh from her maternal grandmother.[26]
                    
                    Lata was named "Hema" at her birth. Her parents later renamed her Lata after a female character, Latika, in one of her father's plays, भाव बंधन.[27]
                    
                    She was the eldest child in the family. Meena, Asha, Usha and Hridaynath, in birth order, are her siblings; all are accomplished singers and musicians.[28]
                    
                    She received her first music lesson from her father. At the age of five, she started to work as an actress in her father's musical plays (Sangeet Natak in Marathi). On her first day of school,[27] Mangeshkar left because she was not allowed to bring her sister Asha along with her.
